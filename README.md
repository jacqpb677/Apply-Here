# Apply-Here! This is a no-frills sample job application form. The task: create an efficient, sensible experience for the applicant. Specific themes/fixes:
#### [1] RADIO BUTTONS over dropdowns. I've researched why an author might choose dropdowns over radio buttons... I don't fully buy it.
#### [2] I saw this a lot: q6: Do you live in NYC? YES / NO. q7: If not: will you relocate to NYC? YES / NO. Bit of a dilemma there if my q6 is a YES.
#### [3] Clean up the clunky military service section.
#### [4] Resume upload includes a naming convention.
#### [5] Applicant can declare highest completed education <i>as well as</i> in-progress education (if it applies).
#### [6] Add a section at the bottom for general notes / anything else the reviewer should know.
